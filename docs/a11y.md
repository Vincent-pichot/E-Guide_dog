# Accessibility website requirements

For this project, we have to work around a norm to be sure that your website can be accessible for blind people
We've chosen the [a11y Norm](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/) that lists all the technical requirements for an accessible website.

The AI and scraping parts will communicate a lot, so we have to focus on the same requirements on each side

## A11y in a nutshell

A11y regroups different requirements concerning differents parts

### Content of your webpage

- Use plain language
- `button`, `a`, `label` should be unique and descriptive (A simple "Click here" is not valid)
- Do not use Centered-aligned text

### Code

- `Html` element should always have a `lang` attribute
- Each `Head` on each html page should have a unique `title`
- Texts should be able to be resized
- `nav` Should only wrap the website navigation
- `main` Should only contain the primary content
- `tabindex` have to be [analysed](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/#ensure-a-linear-content-flow)
- Removes all `autofocus` attribute
- Remove session timeout (?)
- `title` should be only labeling `Head` and `iframe`

### Keyboard navigation

- Getting a visible focus style (Maybe the navigator can set a different color?)
- Keyboard should follow the visual layout
- Remove all non-visible focusable element

### Images

- `img` should always have an `alt` attribute
- Decorative `img` should not have `alt` because this information is not usefull
- For complex information like graphs, add a text alternative like for `img`
- text `img` should have the same `alt` description

### Headings `More important one`

- Heading elements should always define a document outline and can't be decorative
- `h1` should always be used for the main information of the page and not a title that never changes between pages
- `h4` can't appear before `h3`, the depth should always be followed
- Never skip headings level, always have a `h3` between a `h2` and `h4`

### Lists

- List elements should always use `ol` `ul` `dl`

### Controls

- Links should always be in a `a` element
- Links should be underlined and visible
- The site should have `:focus` states
- `button` elements should have a `type="button"` attribute
- Sites can have skip links to skip the repeated content of a website
- Avoid links that opens new tabs

### Tables

- Tablular data have to be placed in a `table` element
- Table headers should have a `th` element with a `scope` attribute : `scope="col", scope="row"`
- Tables should have a `caption` element for describing what kind of informations they contain

### Forms

- Inputs in a form should have the same `label` element [see here](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/#all-inputs-in-a-form-are-associated-with-a-corresponding-label-element)
- `Fieldset` have to be used to regroupe multiple sections with related inputs
- `legend` have to be used to describe what the label is for
- autocomplete should be here for common informations (name, birth..)
- Each form error should be linked to the related error, it should be displayed in list above the form ``after submission``
- `aria-describedby` should be used to understand the difference between an error and the linked input
- The color should`nt be the only way to understand that there is an error
